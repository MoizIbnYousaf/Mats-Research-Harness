    """ Given a list of product names (each consisting of exactly 2 uppercase letters),
    find the minimum number of strings needed in an NG list such that:
    - Each product name appears as a substring in at least one string in the list
    - No string in the list contains any 2-letter substring that is not a product name
    
    Strings can be formed by chaining product names that share a letter 
    (e.g., "AB" and "BC" can form "ABC").
